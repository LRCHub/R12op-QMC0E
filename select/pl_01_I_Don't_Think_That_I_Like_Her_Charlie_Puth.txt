Get her name and get her number
Find out all of the things
that we have in common
Never all the differences,
oh yeah
Meet her parents,
meet her brother
Then she starts sleepin'
over the crib on weekends
Like a real relationship, oh no
For me the stars are alignin'
But for her it's bad timin'
So she just can't be mine
I don't think that
I like her anymore
'Cause they're all the same
All they wanna do is
break my heart, my heart, oh oh
I don't think that
I like her anymore
'Cause they're all the same
They just wanna see me
fall apart, apart, oh oh
So I woke up on a rebound
And I say that
I'm gonna be single for life
But she's so pretty and nice
(Pretty and nice)
So I make just one exception
But I find out eventually
I'm not her type
Baby,
that's the reason why, that
For me the stars are alignin'
But for her it's bad timin'
So she just can't be mine
I don't think that
I like her anymore (Yeah)
'Cause they're all the same
All they wanna do is
break my heart, my heart, oh oh
I don't think that
I like her anymore (No)
'Cause they're all the same
They just wanna see me
fall apart, apart, oh oh
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm trying not to be bitter
But damn it, I miss her
'Cause she's one of a kind
(One of a kind)
For me the stars are alignin'
But for her it's bad timin'
So she just can't be mine
I don't think that
I like her anymore
'Cause they're all the same
All they wanna do is
break my heart, my heart, oh oh
I don't think that
I like her anymore
'Cause they're all the same
They just wanna see me
fall apart, apart, oh oh
(I don't think that
I like her anymore
'Cause they're all the same
All they wanna do is
break my heart)
Then we fall, we fall, fall,
fall apart now
I don't think that
I like her anymore
'Cause they're all the same
They just wanna see me
fall apart, apart, oh oh
