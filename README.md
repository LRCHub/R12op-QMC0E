[00:10.31] Get her name and get her number
[00:13.07] Find out all of the things that we have in common
[00:16.83] Never all the differences, ooh, yeah
[00:20.68] Meet her parents, meet her brother
[00:23.11] Then she starts sleepin' over the crib on weekends
[00:26.94] Like a real relationship, oh, no
[00:42.94] 
[00:31.62] For me, the stars are alignin'
[00:34.82] But for her, it's bad timin'
[00:37.27] So she just can't be mine
[00:49.77] 
[00:41.66] I don't think that I like her anymore
[00:45.45] Girls are all the same
[00:47.01] All they wanna do is break my heart, my heart, ah-ah
[00:52.17] I don't think that I like her anymore
[00:55.92] Girls are all the same
[00:57.49] They just wanna see me fall apart, apart, ah-ah
[01:20.99] 
[01:02.03] So I hook up on a rebound
[01:04.42] And I say that I'm gonna be single for life
[01:08.37] But she's so pretty and nice (pretty and nice)
[01:12.29] So I make just one exception
[01:14.71] But I find out eventually I'm not her type
[01:18.81] Baby, that's the reason why, that
[01:35.31] 
[01:23.12] For me, the stars are alignin'
[01:26.42] But for her, it's bad timin'
[01:29.10] So she just can't be mine
[01:41.60] 
[01:33.29] I don't think that I like her anymore (yeah)
[01:37.06] Girls are all the same
[01:38.86] All they wanna do is break my heart, my heart, ah-ah
[01:43.64] I don't think that I like her anymore (no)
[01:47.61] Girls are all the same
[01:49.07] They just wanna see me fall apart, apart, ah-ah
[02:12.57] 
[02:04.51] I'm trying not to be bitter
[02:07.82] But damn it, I miss her
[02:10.34] 'Cause she's one of a kind (one of a kind)
[02:14.84] For me, the stars are alignin'
[02:18.11] But for her, it's bad timin'
[02:20.75] So she just can't be mine
[02:33.25] 
[02:24.88] I don't think that I like her anymore
[02:28.63] Girls are all the same
[02:30.26] All they wanna do is break my heart, my heart, ah-ah
[02:35.35] I don't think that I like her anymore
[02:39.20] Girls are all the same
[02:40.52] They just wanna see me fall apart, apart, ah-ah
[03:04.02] 
[02:52.86] Then we fall, fall, fall, fall apart now
[02:55.97] I don't think that I like her anymore
[02:59.65] Girls are all the same
[03:01.36] They just wanna see me fall apart, apart, ah-ah
